            <p>The Attendance Review page allows for the ability to review lesson attendance record over a chosen period. With the use of the Filter Sidebar you can refine by field such as attendance status, tutor, and funding type. These records are displayed in chronological order so can be particularly useful for an attendance officer to review attendance during a specific time period. Selecting a lesson record will open the <a href="#individual_records">Individual Records</a> table for that lesson.</p>

            <p>Individual Records are similar to the Attendance Review page; however, will only show records for the specific lesson. Again these records can be refined to a particular date range using the date pickers. Added functionality is the abilty to edit an attendance record and to view and add lesson notes. Lessons with associated notes will have a coloured-in sticky note, while those without notes have a blank note.</p>

            <p>The Overview page provides a wider view than the review pages and can be used to get a quick glimps at trends occuring for individual lessons. It is quick to see the proportion of different attendance states and pick up on reoccuring absences or latenesses promptly. This can either be viewed per instrument/lesson type or viewing all lessons.</p>
